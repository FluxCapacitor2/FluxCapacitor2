## 👋 Hi there! 
### ℹ About Me
I do some coding sometimes, trying to contribute to more open source projects in the future!

- 📕 High school student who loves programming in my spare time
- 🎮 I love playing and coding for Minecraft
<!--
// Haven't worked on this in a while. Maybe one day when I learn more about k8s, Docker, and Minestom. I'm just more interested in client mods for now.
