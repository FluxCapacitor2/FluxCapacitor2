## 👋 Hi there! 
### ℹ About Me
My name is Brendan, and I love solving complex problems. I am a Computer Science student at North Carolina State University, and I have been doing computer programming as a hobby for over 7 years, building projects like [BlueDragon](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/) (Kubernetes, Kotlin, Next.js, MongoDB), [Easysearch](https://github.com/FluxCapacitor2/easysearch/) (Go, SQLite), and a [capture-the-flag recruitment challenge](https://www.bswanson.dev/projects/ctf/) (Next.js, Docker, SQLite) for my high school's cybersecurity team.

I'm also working part-time at Purdue's [Rosen Center for Advanced Computing](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/) on [AnvilOps](https://anvilops.rcac.purdue.edu/), a platform-as-a-service that automates the build and deployment process needed to run apps on Kubernetes.

### 🛠 Currently Working On: 🐲 BlueDragon
BlueDragon is a custom Minecraft server network with original and innovative minigames. It's built on Kubernetes with [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/) for game server management and [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) for CI/CD. Deployed applications include a Minecraft [server implementation](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/Server/) written in Kotlin (based on [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom/)), a queue service that communicates with game servers over [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), and a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 14 website that displays player statistics from our MongoDB database.
